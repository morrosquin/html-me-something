          <h2>How it started</h2>
              <p> My kitchen has been the testing lab for many YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest recipes, and most of my relatives and close friends are the guinea pigs for these oven experiments. <br> 
               My first pastries, however, were worth first prize at the Nailed It competition, but little by little I've found the way to combine ingredients and even integrate some Mexican flavors in my creations.</p>
             <p> I'm now quite skilled at making desserts and I've succesfully opened <strong>ale&ele bake</strong>, an online pastry catering service</p>

         <h2>About us</h2>
             <p>We are mother and son. I was born and raised in Mexico, where I had the great fortune of spending my youth in my parents' farm. <br>
              The sweet smell of the freshly baked apple bread that my mom made at the farm is my most precious childhood memory. <br>
              When I became a mother, I wanted to recreate that experience for Eleazar, my two-year old son. I only had one problem: I didn't know how to bake.</p>
